# Brain Stroke Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict brain strokes using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of various classification algorithms. The models are trained and evaluated for accuracy, and hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes medical records with features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, and more. The target variable indicates whether a patient has had a stroke.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the distribution and relationships of features.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Applying Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using grid search to find the best hyperparameters for the models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
