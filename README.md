# Brain-Stroke-Prediction
A machine learning project to predict brain strokes using various classification algorithms. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation. This project focuses on predicting the occurrence of brain strokes based on a dataset of medical records. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, and confusion matrices are used to assess their performance. Grid search is employed for hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy.
